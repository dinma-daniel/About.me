*Describe yourself with your script*

You have full creative control over the content of your script. In any way you deem fit tell us about yourself in your script 



## Getting Started

- You are expected to add your script into the folder that represents your  language. Please one script per user. 
- To add your to the repo; you fork the repo, add your script, and then make a pull request.
- Explain with a one line comment at the end of your code how the script describes you 
- **DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO ANOTHER PERSONS SCRIPT. IT WOULD NOT BE MERGED**
